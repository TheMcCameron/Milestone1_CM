                    and experimental research using scientifically rigorous social science methods. 
                    The CARIT is a valuable resource for faculty in need of assistance for research projects, grants, and contracts. 
                    In addition, community organizations and agencies can utilize the CARIT in a variety of areas such as program evaluation or community surveys.
